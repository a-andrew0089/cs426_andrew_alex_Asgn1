'What Home Means to You'

For the theme of this game I decided on re-creating a main road in my home town that I've been up and down countless times, usually at night. I took the "home"
part a bit literally and added three houses to represent the three different houses I've lived in while there, each very different from the next. Finally I added the cars
to represent the different vehicles I spent most of my time in. One being a work van and the other being my own personal car, both of which I used a lot for work.
